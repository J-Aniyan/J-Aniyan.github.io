MATLAB PENDULUM SIMULATION

This program simulates the motion of a pendulum through simple harmonic motion (SHM) and non-SHM. 
Its position, speed, length of wire and gravitational acceleration are set by the user and the program outputs a graph of theta against time, showing its motion over time.
The period is also calculated and displayed, along with all other data, on a separate excel file. 
The purpose of this program is to gain a better understanding of SHM and non-SHM by investigating how the variables affect the motion of the pendulum.
