MATLAB THREE-BODY SIMULATION PROJECT

This project was the product of my final year BSc Physics Dissertation. It simulates the three-body problem with Newton's laws of motion and 
numerical integration. The user sets the mass, acceleration and position of each body in a 2D or 3D space, depending on which version of the program is used. 
The time under which the simulation runs is also set. 
All the variables have to be set in the code itself by the User as there unfortunately is no user interface

Included in the project folder:
- threeBody2D_final.m
This is the simulation in 2D space.
- threeBody3D_final.m
This is the simulation in 3D space.
- Poster.pptx
Summary of my project in poster format.
- Final Dissertation Jacob Aniyan .docx
Full copy of my final dissertation, which includes full documentation of development.

Running the code will require valid MATLAB licence.
